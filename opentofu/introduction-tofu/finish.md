# Summary

This introduction scenario covered the complete OpenTofu lifecycle management workflow, 
from initial setup to resource destruction. You learned how to initialize OpenTofu projects, 
create and validate configuration plans, deploy infrastructure resources, and make updates to 
existing deployments. The hands-on experience with a Docker container web server demonstrated 
the core OpenTofu commands: `init`, `plan`, `apply`, and `destroy`. By completing this scenario, 
you now understand the fundamental concepts of Infrastructure as Code and can apply OpenTofu to 
manage infrastructure resources effectively.
