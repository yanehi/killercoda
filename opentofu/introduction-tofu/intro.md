# Introduction to Terraform/OpenTofu with Docker

Welcome to this hands-on scenario! Over the course of this introduction scenario you will learn the basic concepts of the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool Terraform/OpenTofu, hereby learning the fundamentals to
 - define your infrastructure in a describtive way, 
 - establish processes to initializes project ressouces with the defined scripts and
 - managing the lifecycle (like creating, updating or deleting) infrastructure ressources 

## Learning Objectives
- Understand Terraform/OpenTofu syntax and configuration files
- Work with providers, using the the Docker provider from Kreuzwert as an example
- Manage Docker resources using code
- Use essential Terraform commands and manipulate state
- Apply best practices for IaC

## Prerequisites
- Basic command-line knowledge
- Familiarity with Docker concepts (containers, images)
- No prior Terraform experience required

## Scenario Overview
You will complete a series of tasks, each building on the previous, to gain practical experience with Terraform/OpenTofu and Docker. Please note that Docker Providers was chosen as the basis for this learning material because the variety of resources is limited and the configuration options are therefore less complex than those offered by cloud providers or similar providers. However, the knowledge gained can also be applied to all other providers.
